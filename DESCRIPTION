Description: Generates Raven like matrices according to different rules and the response list associated to the matrix. The package can generate matrices composed of 4 or 9 cells, along with a response list of 11 elements (the correct response + 10 incorrect responses). The matrices can be generated according to both logical rules (i.e., the relationships between the elements in the matrix are manipulated to create the matrix) and visual-spatial rules (i.e., the visual or spatial characteristics of the elements are manipulated to generate the matrix).
    The graphical elements of this package are based on the 'DescTools' package.
